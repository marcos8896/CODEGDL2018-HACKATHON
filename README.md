# CODEGDL-CSV-IMPORTER
This project makes it possible to generate a huge amount of data from CSV files which contains related columns.
It was built on top of the Loopbback NodeJS Framework, because of the scalability and extensible queries that it can perform on multiple databases. In this case, we use MySQL to store our data.

### Custom NPM commands and their respective requirements.

| Command | Requirement |

| npm run generate-csv-from-xlxs | This command require a Linux System Operative to make it work. It generates all the needed CSV files from their respectives XLXS files. |
| npm run dangerous-migration | This command run the project migrations, deleting the current database and creating a new one with the latests Schemas. After that, it retrieves all the data from the CSV files and store it on the database. |
| npm run full-initial-script | It runs all the previous commands within the proper order. |
| npm run filtering | It generates a new CSV file from the given params on the script. |
